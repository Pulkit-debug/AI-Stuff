My name is pulkit
i am 24 years old
i work in as a devops engineer in Freecharge.com
freecharge is actually owned by axis bank
before that it was owened by snap deal
pulkit currently bought a graphic tablet and it actually works nice with some lag when he tries to run it in online tools like figma

pulkit has a very strict policy in his mind that he wants to retire by the age of 40/45 
he wants to have crores in account
he wants to build something of his own ( a bzness maybe)
some days ago he went to udaipur with his friend named ankit
just yesterday he fought with his so called girlfriend who thinks all this ai agentic things that he is trying to learn is bullshit
and it contains no actual value lol.
