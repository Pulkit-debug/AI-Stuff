The
COVID-19 pandemic
was confirmed to have reached the U.S. state of
Oregon
on February 28, 2020. On that day, Governor
Kate Brown
created a coronavirus response team; on March 8 she declared a state of emergency; and on March 23 she issued a statewide
stay-at-home order
with class C
misdemeanor
charges for violators.
In April 2020, Oregon joined Washington and California in the
Western States Pact
, an agreement to coordinate the restarting of economic activity while controlling the outbreak. By the end of June 2020, Governor Brown announced that face masks would be required indoors, effective July 1.
Economic impacts of COVID-19 in Oregon included stock market losses for major companies, reduced airline flights, losses for food and entertainment industries, and closures of libraries and museums.
In early March 2020, universities and K–12 schools closed statewide, and began providing online instruction. Professional and college sports teams cancelled training, games, and tournaments.
By May 14, 2021, 31 of Oregon's 36 counties had met OHA requirements to enter the first phase of a three-phase process to reopen businesses.
As of September 1, 2022
[update]
, 77.3% of the adult population has completed the primary vaccination series. 84.9% of the state's adult population has received at least one dose of a vaccine.

On February 28, 2020, the
Oregon Health Authority
(OHA) reported the first case of suspected coronavirus in a resident of
Washington County
who had not traveled to an infected area, likely indicating that the virus had been contracted within the community.
[
4
]
Because he was identified as an employee at Forest Hills Elementary School in the
Lake Oswego School District
in adjacent
Clackamas County
, the school was closed for three days for deep cleaning.
[

]
[
5
]
The case was confirmed as coronavirus by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) on March 3.
[
6
]
On March 1, Oregon confirmed its second case, a household contact of its first case.
[
7
]
The employee, later identified as the school building engineer, was treated with
Remdesivir
and was released from the hospital more than two months later.
[
5
]
On March 7, health officials identified four new presumptive positive cases among residents in Jackson, Klamath, and Washington counties.
[
8
]
On March 8, the OHA added seven new presumptive positive cases to Oregon's count.
[
9
]
On March 10, the OHA announced Multnomah County's first presumptive positive case, bringing Oregon's total to fifteen cases in seven counties.
[
10
]
On March 11, OHA confirmed four new cases, one new case each in Deschutes, Marion, Polk, and Umatilla  counties.
[
11
]
They later announced Linn County's first two presumptive positive cases.
[
12
]
On March 16, 2020,
Providence Health Systems
,
Kaiser Permanente
,
Legacy Health
, and
Oregon Health & Science University
formed a coalition to set up a regional
health system
in the state in order to address anticipated need for capacity and coordination to address the outbreak.
[

Amid coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes, including those run by
Avamere
, the company donated $20,000 to a
PAC
tied to Oregon governor Kate Brown.
[
14
]
42-year-old Vladislav V. Drozdek was arrested on March 23 trying to sell stolen
N95 hospital masks
in
Beaverton
. The masks were donated to local hospitals.
[

]
A study by the Oregon Health Authority found that 1% of subjects had developed COVID-19 antibodies. This is ten times the rate found via conventional testing. Between May 11 and June 15 in 2020, 897 blood samples were collected. Of those, 9 contained antibodies.
[
16
]
Later events
[
edit
]
In August and September 2021, despite wide availability of vaccines, the most severe wave of COVID-19 infections statewide caused Oregon hospitals to cancel elective procedures and degrade medical care for non-emergency patients. Approximately four out of five COVID-19 patients were unvaccinated, meaning most of the hospitalizations were preventable.

The
Oregon Health Authority
publishes weekly outbreak reports for COVID-19 cases, sorted by active and resolved cases in specific workplaces, senior care facilities, child care facilities, and
K–12
schools.
[

A detailed weekly data report covering clinical characteristics, demographics, weekly hospitalizations, and recovery time is also available.
[

An outbreak occurred at the 154-bed
Edward C. Allworth Veterans' Home
in
Lebanon
,
Linn County
. By March 16, 2020, the virus was confirmed in 13 residents (most over age 70) and one healthcare worker. With 151 residents and 225 workers, the county health director said, "I can't stop it. I can't stop the virus. I can't make test kits appear", but there was some optimism that the spread would be slow since the retirement home is divided into eleven housing units with 14 residents each. In 2016, the average resident age was 85, with an average length of stay being 50 days.

In Portland, Healthcare at Foster Creek (operating as St. Jude Operating Company with Melchor Balaz as its registered agent, part of
Benicia Senior Living
), had 119 cases and 29 deaths by mid-May 2020. The facility's first case was reported on March 24. An employee reported a lack of PPE to Oregon
OSHA
on March 26, though an
Oregon Department of Human Services
(DHS) investigation found it was "unsubstantiated for violations". Five deaths were reported in the week following the complaint. DHS and the facility agreed to a Letter of Intent for assistance on staffing and PPE, and the two signed with
American Medical Response
to assess and transport residents. DHS conducted a 3-day inspection beginning April 12; the facility had 10 deaths by then. On April 15, the inspection reported they "failed to ensure appropriate measures .. to prevent the spread of COVID-19", and that it "presents an immediate risk" to the patients and staff. DHS revoked new admissions at the facility, appointed a temporary management consultant, and inspected the facility daily. By April 16, there had been 50 cases and 14 deaths. On April 18,
Oregon's Office of Emergency Management
issued a partial evacuation order. DHS conducted a second significant survey of the facility beginning on April 24, and on April 28 CMS issued a "notice of involuntary termination" if the facility didn't correct its operating conditions by May 17. DHS had reports that coronavirus-positive staff were working in the facility, though not directly with patients. By May 5, there were 117 cases and 28 deaths; 55 patients had been sent to the hospital. Their fatalities were over half of all coronavirus fatalities in Portland. The facility's license was suspended on that date, effective immediately, meaning the facility was closed and the remaining 11 residents were evacuated by DHS.

Avamere
senior care community, reported 48 cases with four deaths by May 12, 2020, up from 38 cases and four deaths by April 14. The cluster was publicized by
The Oregonian
on April 3, as DHS refused to publish counts until mid-April. On April 3,
The Oregonian
located 14 residents and 15 staff confirmed with COVID-19. On April 9, the facility opened 47 beds for coronavirus patients who had been released from a hospital as part of an

The Lighthouse Pentecostal Church in
Union County
's
Island City
is the site of the largest outbreak in the state. By June 16 there were 236 cases linked to the church, out of 240 cases in the county. It was noted that the church held in-person services without social distancing or masks in April and as late as May 24, and the church had also held a wedding and a graduation, each attended by over 100 people. The May 24 service was announced on Facebook, stating "In accordance with President Trump, Lighthouse Church ... will be open. We will be having regular services as of Sunday 24, 2020". Union County commissioners Donna Beverage and Paul Anderes were part of a "secret meeting" by leaders of seven counties held on June 11 to make "battle plans" to reject the coronavirus restrictions put in place by the governor.

had 74 cases, including a Lead Pastor and his spouse being hospitalized with COVID-19.
[

[

By May 10, 2021, the church outbreak was resolved at 89 cases.
[

KinderCare, the Portland-based operator of 1,500 daycare centers in 40 states, said it will temporarily shut more than two-thirds of its centers because of the coronavirus pandemic.
